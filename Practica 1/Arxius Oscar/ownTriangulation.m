function [At, bt]= ownTriangulation(A,b)
% [At,bt] = ownTriangulation(A,b)
% Performs a forward elimination proces over the matrix [A b]
%	such that A*x = b and At*x = bt share the same solution x
% Inputs:
%	A: Coefficients matrix
%	b: Independent term
% Outputs:
%	At: Upper triangular matrix
% 	bt: Modified independent term
